## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 1 session / week, 2 hours / session

## Description

This course will explore the organization and functions of the U.S. Intelligence Community, its interaction with national security policymakers, key issues about its workings, and the challenges it faces in defining its future role. The events of 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq have focused new attention on national intelligence, including the most significant reorganization of the community since the National Security Act of 1947. The course will highlight some of the major debates about the role, practices, and problems of national intelligence. Lectures are important and will include a discussion period in each session. Additional readings may be assigned as the semester progresses. One research paper will be required at the end of the semester. Suggested topics will be distributed separately.

## Grading

There is one long paper (about 30 pages) required for this class. Grading is roughly 80% paper, 20% class participation.
